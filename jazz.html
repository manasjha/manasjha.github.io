										<h1>Forlorn Joy; Walking through my Jazz playlist</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/jazz1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Some notes pleasure me most when they resonate silence within them. When the cymbal chimes in the background of my rather expensive earpiece as the saxophone slips into an arpeggio a little too smooth for my adolescent ears, I realize how time is not as quicksilver as I make it seem. Although to be fair to myself, my seemingness of things (including the concept of time, an institution we as children learn to accept at face value without ever realizing the myth behind its foundation) often manifests after taking into account the universal perception behind them. I digress. Blue in Green is on a loop, and it doesn't sound half as pleasing to me the second time around. I shift towards Brubeck, in an attempt to spice up the melancholy of keys and cymbals with a little more tempo.</p>
<p>True jazz musicians play a multitude of instruments, ranging from vibraphones to organs to basses with strings so many that naked eyes would fail to count. But the one instrument that every Jazz musician loves to dance with, is time. The transformation of a set of notes into music (At this point, I'd like to take the liberty of using this word in its purest sense, without really understanding what it truly represents) is through the flavor of time that separates each note by a distance far enough to make me anxious and yet close enough to not agitate the short attention span that the West has gifted me these past few birthdays. The brilliance of Jazz, for me, is the ubiquitous influence of time on it. The piano solo on the ninth minute of Blue Train by John Coltrane is surreal not because of its complexity but because of the manner in which it transcends into a slow, almost 'Snorlaxy' bass segment; a bass segment that teasingly pauses every sixteen notes and brings down the tempo of a song in a way my lazy brain almost fails to notice. I fall in love with those pauses and claim that they give Coltrane his true identity. You, as the reader (and a rather skeptic one, I assume, considering how understanding of intricate detail in music is not expected from a member of a generation known to not bat a lid at anything under a hundred and twenty beats per minute, and a million decibel of amplitude) can question the importance of time being a quantity in Jazz as vital as I claim it to be. And all I can do in response is assert, as Blue Train fades out and my lips give a crooked smile to the opening notes of Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue. Is Blue the color of Jazz?</p>
									<center><span class="image "><img src="images/jazz2.jpg" alt="" /></span></center>
									<br><p>Historians and Jazz critics often debate about the true genre of Rhapsody In Blue, considering the abundance of classical orchestra in its composition. I don't pay much heed to that debate, primarily due to my lack of knowledge about what shapes classical music, but also due to the flawlessness of the rhythmic piano solos sprinkled all over the composition. Rhapsody In Blue is one of the few rhapsodies in American Jazz that demonstrated the skillful and elaborate use of piano solos as a method to kindle melody into a composition (A fact that even Demi Lovato fans would state with disgusting amounts of obviousness after listening to the opening notes of Cool In The Summer, or for that matter any other Billboard hit). The bastardization of the piano as an instrument included just to 'tone down' the loudness of compositions in modern day band culture truly saddens me. I hold Brubeck in very high regard in this aspect. The genius of Brubeck's playing of the piano, according to me, was the manner in which he used it to lift or drop the tension on a record; by making swift, almost haphazard transitions between various scales. Brubeck liked making his listeners think, as if to guess whether the next note would be a higher or a lower. The use of teasingly delicate piano solos to add tension and character is something Brubeck mastered over the 60's and the 70's. I usually like to save his best for last, and that is what I would like do today as well, unless the sun comes up before my playlist reaches its conclusion and reminds me of the cruel reality that my days are progressing to - tests week.</p>
<p>Miles Davis once said, "I don't care if a dude is purple with green breath as long as he can swing." The nature of Davis' playing in live concerts was centered around improvisation, which is why his concerts in local pubs often lasted for hours. Swinging, during the times of Davis, referred to improvisation by soloists (often sax players) over a certain fixed bass line. Two or more players would usually start improvising parallel arrangements, and the fixed composition and consistent bass line would harmonize the different improvisations into a melody worth tapping your feet to, as you sip your cheap whiskey (Jazz players during those times weren't allowed to perform in upscale restaurants and pubs in America, since most of them used to be Black). Playing swing music was an art that required years to master, but arranging swinging ensembles to sound like music and not a 'Khichdi' of musicians required more than a lifetime, which is probably why some people called Duke Ellington's work eternal. Ellington was one of the best known bandleaders in Swing Jazz music. I'm not a fan of Ellington's work, but a vocal rendition of his composition Come Sunday by Queen Esther Marrow is an absolute classic, and the only record with vocals on my playlist. According to a famous story, when Ellington first composed Come Sunday, he wished to include a baritone sax in the arrangement, but removed it when he first heard Esther Marrow's voice, and remarked, "no saxophone would be able to do what Marrow does to my heart when she holds a note".</p>

									<br><p>The abstract nature of certain truths is an irony I'm slowly developing an elementary understanding of; probably ever since I took up debating. We often fall prey to defining everything around us so methodically that we aren't able to appreciate, or even understand surrealism. And that is probably why I'm unable to explain to myself why Jazz wouldn't be Jazz without men like Coltrane, Brubeck and Nelson flirting with time signatures and pauses in their compositions. For years, I had been ignorant to the ingenuity of Nelson, knowing him solely for Stolen Moments - a nine minute Jazz standard that every elementary Jazz fan would know of; for its twelve-bar blues minors and Nelson's rare use of augmented scales in his saxophone solo in the fifth minute of the record. But Nelson achieved something far greater in his blues career - the feat of being called a Blues musician despite choosing to never constrict his composition to the twelve bar form that defines the Blues genre. In a way, that is what makes his album 'The Blues and the Abstract Truth' so special for me - Through his 'out of the blues' writing he challenges the institution behind Jazz Blues, yet never letting our faith in him waiver.</p>

									<br><p>I'd like the concluding segment of this article to be about two things - An explanation of the title of this article, and an admission of my love for arguably Brubeck's best work and the last item on tonight's playlist. I will start with the latter. I first heard Take 5 while travelling in a bus, from Shimla to Dharamsala. It was an odd inclusion in a playlist that was centered on retro hits by Rafi. When I asked the driver about 'that one song he played which didn't have any vocals', he told me about the time Paul Desmond came to Shimla in the late 50's and his father chauffeured him around the city. I heard it again when I was back home, and listening the piano vamp in the first minute of the song back then was an experience simply too surreal for a fifteen year old to quantify. Of course, I got bored of the record after the first few minutes; after all the love for alternate rock in your mid teens is something that even Brubeck can't get rid of that easily. I took to Jazz a few years later when my 12th grade English teacher made me do some reading on Paul Desmond, again with Take 5 being the centerpiece of my Jazz fever. I personally credit Brubeck more for the brilliance of the record, even though Paul Desmond was the man behind its elaborate literature. Brubeck's piano vamp ( A vamp is a simple musical progression that is made to loop at the same pitch, kind of like the way certain melodies repeat continuously in modern day EDM songs) through the song, and his use of the then obsolete 5/4 time is what defines the 'feel of Jazz' for me. And I realize that in this aspect I differ from most contemporary Jazz enthusiasts, who rely on elaborate bass lines and baritone saxophones to classify the true nature of Jazz. But then, I'm 20, and I literally know almost nothing about Jazz, or even music. I don't care.</p>

									<br><p>What really makes me sad at this point of time is not my half broken knowledge and understanding of Jazz, but the stigma that Jazz comes with today. The fact that I can truly appreciate the brilliance of Brubeck and all those who preceded him in this playlist only when I'm sitting alone with dimmed lights is what makes this experience all the more curious. It reminds me how slowing things down gives you the time to understand them better. Time is relative, and for the likes of Yo Yo Honey Singh (An Indian Hip Hop sensation who my very close friends love idolizing at full volume and questionable sobriety levels), it needs to be sped up to not let the listeners notice the banality of his work. But Brubeck makes me wait, and just long enough for me to ease into the complexity of his work. And that is what makes this entire experience a forlorn celebration of joy - we can appreciate the genius of Jazz at the cost of doing it alone, but when we're out, fun is sponsored by whatever Billboard declares good music to be.</p>
